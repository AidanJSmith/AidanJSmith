## 👋 Howdy, I'm Aidan!

I'm a full-time software engineer at Neuralink and a focused student at Georgia Tech (simulataneously 🛬 🛫).

In addition to loving computers (duh!), my interests include history, linguistics, psychology, and the relationship between humans and nature.

- Working on react+wasm stuff.
- Exploring PDM signal processing
- Brushing up on my multivariate statistics for fun
- Reading Joan Didion

### Previously, I... 👨‍💻

- Built [Neuralink's Website](https://www.neuralink.com)
- Biked the Oregon Outback trail 🚲 .
- Ran a marathon with no training because i firmly believe grit is all you need 🏃
