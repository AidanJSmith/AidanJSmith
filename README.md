## 👋 Howdy, I'm Aidan!

I'm a full-time software engineer at Neuralink, a focused student at Georgia Tech, and a huge tree hugger
In addition to loving computers (duh!), my interests include history, linguistics, psychology, and the relationship between humans and nature.

- Biking the Oregon Outback trail 🚲
- Working on react+wasm stuff

### Previously, I... 👨‍💻
- Worked as a Software Engineer for Chess.com, where I built lots of neat features and played a lot of chess ♟️
- Built [Neuralink's Website](https://www.neuralink.com)
- Took off a month to hike the entire [Colorado Trail](https://coloradotrail.org) alone. ⛰️
