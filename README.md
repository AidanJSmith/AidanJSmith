## 👋 Howdy, I'm Aidan!

I'm a thiel fellow building my own thing — but I used to be a software engineer at Neuralink (and Georgia Tech supercommuter +_+).

In addition to loving computers (duh!), my interests include history, linguistics, psychology, and the relationship between humans and nature.

### Currently I'm... :shipit:
- In a cabin in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming writing a lot of code.
- Reading plenty of books — Talleyrand, Fractals Everywhere, and more!
- Doing some alignment research for fun

### Previously, I... 👨‍💻
- Built neat software for Neuralink's human studies 💻. My main focus right now is doing ML research and deploying novel models at scale.
- Worked as a full time Software Engineer for Chess.com (started @16!), where I built lots of neat features and played a lot of chess ♟️
- Built [Neuralink's Website](https://www.neuralink.com)
- Took off a month to hike the entire [Colorado Trail](https://coloradotrail.org) alone. ⛰️
- Won NuevaHacks III out of over 400 teams with some friendos
