## 👋 Howdy, I'm Aidan!

I'm a full-time software engineer at Neuralink, a focused student at Georgia Tech, and a huge tree hugger.

_I hope to ship great code that helps people ..._

_... while not losing touch with a humanistic view of the world._


In addition to loving computers (duh!), my interests include history, linguistics, psychology, and the relationship between humans and nature.


### Currently I'm... :shipit:
- Taking off the month of July to hike the entire [Colorado Trail](https://coloradotrail.org) alone. ⛰️
- Building neat software ahead of Neuralink's human studies 💻
- Finally getting around to reading Gödel Escher Bach 📘

### Previously, I... 👨‍💻
- Worked as a Software Engineer for Chess.com, where I built lots of neat features and played a lot of chess ♟️
- Wrote over 100,000 words of notes in markdown and latex in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my classes... and curiousity
- Built [Neuralink's Website](Neuralink.com)
- Won NuevaHacks III out of over 400 teams with some friendos
