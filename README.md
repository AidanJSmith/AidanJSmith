## 👋 Howdy, I'm Aidan!

I'm a software engineer at Neuralink (and former Georgia Tech supercommuter).

In addition to loving computers (duh!), my interests include history, linguistics, psychology, and the relationship between humans and nature.

### Currently I'm... :shipit:
- Building neat software for Neuralink's human studies 💻. My main focus right now is doing ML research and deploying novel models at scale.
- Getting read to bike the Tour Divide 🚴
- Doing some alignment research for fun

### Previously, I... 👨‍💻
- Worked as a full time Software Engineer for Chess.com (started @16!), where I built lots of neat features and played a lot of chess ♟️
- Built [Neuralink's Website](https://www.neuralink.com)
- Biked the Oregon Outback trail 🚲 .
- Ran a marathon with no training because i firmly believe grit is all you need 🏃
- Took off a month to hike the entire [Colorado Trail](https://coloradotrail.org) alone. ⛰️
- Won NuevaHacks III out of over 400 teams with some friendos
